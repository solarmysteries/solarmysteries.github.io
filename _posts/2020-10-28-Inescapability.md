That's not quite the right word for it but it's the best I found at the moment.
Is that what they all feel?
Not exactly.
To escape presumes an exit, a destination, or at least the possibility of it.
But what exactly is the word for when the concept of departure itself cannot even be conceived and imagined?
When reality is so arid and dissolved that the minds can't find traces and patterns to conceptualise another possibility than that of endless spiritual inertia?
There is another word.
But if I knew the word, I wouldn't be alive to tell you.
And maybe that's why they can't.
